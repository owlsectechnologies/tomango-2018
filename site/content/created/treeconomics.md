Treeconomics works with community groups, research organisations, public bodies, municipalities and private business to help them understand the value of trees.

Treeconomics asked us to completely redesign their website which no longer reflected their brand values or the quality of the work they do. It also wasn’t responsive on mobile devices and was failing to get the key business services
across to the visitor in a clear and concise way.

The new website highlights the key services of the business and showcases a selection of projects Treeconomics has worked on all over the world.

As part of the re-design, we introduce a news section that’s fed from social media accounts, news articles and new projects.

We’ve also added a more detailed About page, which presents the company mission statement, capabilities, and introduces the user to the team members of Treeconomics.
