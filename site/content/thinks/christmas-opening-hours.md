Now that Bonfire Night’s out of the way, it feels like that time of year when our thoughts start turning towards Christmas. 

As with previous years, the office will be closed over the Christmas and New Year period so we can all take a well-earned break and return at the start of January ready to give our clients our very best.

Our opening hours for Christmas 2018 are as follows:

* Friday 21st – closed PM
* Saturday 22nd – closed
* Sunday 23rd – closed
* Monday 24th – closed
* Tuesday 25th – closed
* Wednesday 26th – closed
* Thursday 27th – closed
* Friday 28th – closed
* Saturday 29th – closed
* Sunday 30th – closed
* Monday 31st – closed
* Tuesday 1st – closed
* Wednesday 2nd – open as normal

May we wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy and Prosperous New Year!
