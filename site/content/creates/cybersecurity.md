Whether assessing risk, investigating vulnerabilities, testing for external and internal threats, or engineering a hardened IT security environment, OwlSec delivers the capabilities you need for information security and assurance.

## How we secure your business

Before we even begin consultation or penetration testing, we need to understand what you're business is about, how many employees do you have, Do you conduct basic I.T training, how many people work in the I.T department and what are you after?.

After that we then conduct a penetration test. 

A penetration test emulates the real-world threats and attack vectors you are likely to encounter. 

The goal of a penetration test is to identify the weaknesses and demonstrate the impact before an attacker does. 

We aim at verifying the security posture of a targeted asset.


We never lose sight of the reasons for the service – that’s how we make the biggest difference to your business.
